# Image_clustering
An encoder model is used to cluster images of similar animals.
Since the dataset was quite large, the kernal crashed multiple times both on Colab and my local system.
Hence, I've trained and tested the model on smaller dataset (training set = 1501 , test set = 690).
Even after training on smaller set of data, I did get promising results.
I extracted the features of input images and applied KNN to cluster the similar images.
