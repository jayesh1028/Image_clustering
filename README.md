# Image_clustering
An encoder model is used to cluster similar images of similar animals.
Since the dataset was quite large, the kernal crashed multiple times.
Hence, I've trained and tested the model on smaller dataset (training set = 1501 , test set = 690).
I extracted the features of input images and applied KNN to cluster the similar images.
